# Mauke Community Network

The Mauke Community Network is a digital playground for the Mauke Code Team to grow their web development skills, while building tools for the island community in Mauke, Cook Islands.

We hope to eventually have our network hosted on an offline community network that covers the whole island, so that locals can connect and use it without the need to pay for internet data.

While we establish the infrastructure for our offline community network, our Mauke Community Network will be accessible online at: https://mauke.network
